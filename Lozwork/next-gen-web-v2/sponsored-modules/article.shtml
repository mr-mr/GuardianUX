				<p>Conservative <a href="#">Louise Mensch</a> has announced she is standing down as MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire, saying she was "devastated by the necessary decision" but had to put her young family first.</p>
				<p>She told her followers on Twitter that it had "proved impossible to balance the needs of my family", adding that she had written to David Cameron with her formal letter of resignation.</p>
				<p>"I am devastated by the necessary decision that I have had to announce today. It has been an incredible honour serving the people of #CorbyEN," she tweeted.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>She is accused of conspiring with others, including her husband, Charlie Brooks, the racehorse trainer and friend of the prime minister, and her personal assistant, to conceal material from detectives.</p>
					<p>In a statement, Brooks and her husband – who are both close to David Cameron – condemned the decision made by senior lawyers and overseen by Keir Starmer QC, the director of public prosecutions.</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>Mensch, who is married to the manager of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Peter Mensch, had been finding it increasingly difficult to juggle her family life and her political career, dividing her time between New York, where her husband is based, and the UK.</p>
				<p>She says she has decided to move full-time to New York after reviewing the needs of her young children.</p>
				<p>She phoned her local paper, the Northants Telegraph, on Monday morning to break the news, with a formal announcement to follow on Monday morning.</p>

				<p>"It's been unbelievably difficult to manage family life," she told the paper. "We have been trying to find a way forward with the prime minister's office, but I just can't spend as much time with my children as I want to."</p>
				<p>She added: "I love Corby and East Northamptonshire but my family has to come first. When I took the post I was in a different position but sometimes life throws you a curve ball that you didn't expect. We are now going to be moving out to New York as a family.</p>
				<p>"Every family is different and another mother might feel she can manage things," she said.</p>
				<h2>Decision</h2>
				<p>Her decision will cut short a promising and notable political career. She was elected in 2010 but has made her name as an outspoken MP on the parliamentary select committee investigating news hacking at the News of the World.</p>
				<p>She notably clashed with Labour MP Tom Watson after the Labour MP in the committee's final report when he branded Rupert Murdoch "not fit" to run a company.</p>

				<p>Before entering politics she made her name as a best-selling author, under her maiden name, Bagshawe.</p>
				<p>Mensch faced down a potential career-ending incident after a journalist contacted her to confront her with allegations about taking drugs.</p>
				<p>Defusing a potential row, she pre-empted the journalist's revelations by announcing it was "highly probably" she had taken drugs in her youth. "I'm sure it was not the only incident of the kind; we all do idiotic things when young," she said.</p>

					<li>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua</li>
					<li>Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco </li>
					<li>laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat</li>				
				</ul>
				<p>She won many admirers appearing on Question Time later saying that it had "long term mental health" effects on her.</p>
				<p>"I am somebody who has used drugs in the past, I have used class A drugs in the past, I said this when someone tried to blackmail me over this during the Murdoch hearings.</p>
				<p>"It's something I regret incredibly, that in my youth I messed with my brain," she added.</p>
				<p>Mensch told the Northants Telegraph that she planned to move after the next election in 2015 but was concerned that her children would be too settled in Northamptonshire and it would be unfair to uproot them at that stage.</p>
