			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>An estimated 400-1,200 patients died as a result of poor care over the 50 months between January 2005 and March 2009 at Stafford hospital, a small district general hospital in Staffordshire. The report being published on 6 February 2013 of the public inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC will be the fifth official report into the scandal since 2009, and Francis's second into the hospital's failings.</p>
			<p>The often horrifying evidence that has emerged means "Mid Staffs" has become a byword for NHS care at its most negligent. It is often described as the worst hospital care scandal of recent times. In 2009 Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the Healthcare Commission, the regulator of NHS care standards at the time, said it was the most shocking scandal he had investigated.</p>
			<div class="dwell">
				<p>It is commonly known as the Mid Staffs scandal because Stafford hospital was and is run by the Mid Staffordshire NHS hospital trust, which in 2008 acquired foundation trust status, making it semi-independent of Department of Health (DH) control. Decision-making and especially cost-cutting as part of its pursuit of that status was later cited as a key reason why poor care took hold and was allowed to persist for so long.</p>
				<p>The public inquiry began in July 2010. Its remit was to investigate what a wide range of commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies and systems in the NHS had done to detect poor care at Stafford and to intervene. As such it probed the role of the bodies and individuals all the way from the hospital itself – including the trust's board and its patient liaison group – up to the most senior figures at the Department of Health in Whitehall, including ministers, senior civil servants and key figures in the NHS.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">NHS enemies will declare the service broken. But it is not</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>NHS: no one is safe, shouted the Times front page, among others in the rightwing press. The horror story of cruelty and neglect in Mid Staffs arrives as a ready-made justification for this government's fragmentation of the NHS. You don't need much political nous to detect Jeremy Hunt and his press softening up the public for the idea that the private sector now taking over many NHS contracts will better prevent such outrages in future. With 1.3m patients seen every 36 hours, the NHS, they say, is a Red Army-sized monolith beyond quality control.</p>
								<p>The health service is painfully tarred by this appalling event – and Robert Francis QC is quite right to say it could happen again. Anywhere things can go badly awry, as five other hospitals fall under suspicion. But that frightener needs to be balanced by reading the enormous NHS patient surveys showing these things are rare: more than 90% of patients leaving hospital say their care was good or very good. Ipsos Mori's long series of opinion polling tells a story of high appreciation. The recent unprecedented drop in public attitudes towards the NHS in the British Social Attitudes survey was caused by alarm at the government's NHS and Social Care Act.</p>
								<p>Much indignation this week has fixed on nurses: Cameron used the moment to call for performance-related pay. "Bring back Matron!" some cried, again, imagining some ubiquitous Hattie Jacques. Surely, MPs said, running a ward is easy? It's not rocket science for nice nurses to care kindly, keep people clean and out of pain, feed the frail and answer bedside buzzers? But it's not easy at all. It requires good functioning of a highly complex well-oiled machine.</p>

								<p>The ex-chief nurse at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust has been suspended from practicing for more than two years over claims she put patients at risk as a result of "serious misconduct", it has emerged.</p>
								<p>Janice Harry has been banned from working as a nurse anywhere in the UK since the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), the profession's regulator, imposed an interim suspension order on her in October 2010.</p>
								<p>NMC documentation states that the allegations leading to her suspension "relate to Mrs Harry being in a senior position with responsibilities for the delivery of patient care and failures in her duty of care to maintain a safe level of practice surrounding poor infection control and prevention, the lack of governance regarding patient safety and risk management."</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Francis report: culture change in the NHS will take years</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>So who is going to change the culture in the NHS? Despite the questionable wisdom of making 290 recommendations, some of which seem far too detailed for a public inquiry, Robert Francis's report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal provides solid foundations for changes in the management and clinical practice of the health service – but someone has to make the first move.</p>
								<p>The coincidence of the publication of the inquiry's final report with the imminent change to the new NHS structure does at least provide an opportunity for a new culture to take root in the new organisations. But it will take more than that to change bad habits.</p>
								<p>Some years ago I was talking to a highly respected manager about the experience of discussing problems hitting the four-hour A&amp;E waiting target with his strategic health authority chief executive, David Nicholson. "I didn't need to be told that my career depended on it," he said, "I felt it with every bone in my body."</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs and the NHS: church in need of reformation</a></h3>
							<p>The appalling suffering and needless deaths of hundreds of patients in Stafford hospital are a wake-up call for the National Health Service. Although the NHS has been for the public an almost spiritual preoccupation, summed up by Nigel Lawson's quip that it was the closest we have to a national religion these days, Robert Francis QC's heretical truth among 290 recommendations is that in parts of the health service, it is the culture that kills rather than cures. This may be today's deadly malaise but it is not a new one. Indeed, when another QC, one Geoffrey Howe, led an inquiry in 1967 into serious allegations of abuse and ill-treatment of vulnerable, long-stay patients at the Ely hospital in Cardiff, he concluded that at fault lay "poor clinical leadership, an isolative and inward-looking culture, inadequate management structures and systems".</p>
							<p>Plus ça change, you might think. This would be a mistaken view. All too often in the past, the issue was the clubbiness of the medical profession – exemplified by the closed culture exposed by the public inquiry into Bristol child heart surgery, where doctors put their interests above their patients'. What Francis has done is expose a new unhealthy, managerially obsessive culture of targets, money and incentives. In the case of Mid Staffs, it led to a "culture of self promotion rather than critical analysis and openness". This was not challenged by consultants who "kept their head down" and nurses who "tolerated" poor performance. Running through the Francis report is a call for a new professionalism with a return to the sense of vocation, mission and purpose – where the patients are put first in "a caring and compassionate way". There is little to argue with in these words.</p>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>Francis's x-ray of the NHS highlights a chain of failure – in hospitals, in layers of health service oversight, by regulators and by professional bodies. There is also an important difference between today's NHS and the one which Stafford hospital experienced: money. In these times of austerity the health service is being asked to save money rather than spend it.</p>
								<p>In responding to the report, David Cameron adopted a measured tone and asked the probing question – and was right to ask, given the scale of systemic failure – why has not one person been prosecuted. It could have hardly escaped his notice that just two days ago a former director of nursing at Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, there at the time of the crisis, was cleared of any wrong-doing by the professional standards bodies for nurses. Little wonder that the coalition's secretary of state for health will be writing to the medical regulators in the coming days asking why professionals are still allowed to work despite their time at Stafford hospital. There is a lingering suspicion that the government will seek to use the Francis report as cover to further its own agenda – and there were unfortunately signs of this in Mr Cameron's attempt to link nurses' pay to quality of care.</p>
								<p>To open up the health service, Francis wants to refound the NHS on principles of transparency, candour and openness and put the patient's voice at the heart of the service. Again, the coalition may seek to put this report to the service of a more ideological project – reforming the NHS on the lines of choice and competition. But this is a necessary risk. Francis's call for criminal sanctions for those that cause harm and for doctors and managers to have a duty to reveal instances of poor care are necessary steps to make profound change in the NHS.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">David Cameron's prescription for NHS failings: target pay of nurses</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>David Cameron wants nurses' pay to be tied to how well they look after patients as part of changes to banish poor care in the NHS in response to the devastating findings of a report published on Wednesday into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal.</p>
								<p>The prime minister told MPs the change should reward nurses who provide excellent care as the government began considering the 290 far-reaching recommendations set out by inquiry chairman, Robert Francis QC, to improve patient safety and overhaul what he called a flawed, self-serving "NHS system".</p>
								<p>Cameron identified the NHS's 300,000 nurses as the key group of health professionals to improve patients' experience of the service. He pledged to respond to Francis's proposals within a month but also backed a shakeup of nurses' salaries as one of a number of moves that need to be made without delay, alongside appointing a first chief inspector of hospitals to investigate where concerns have been raised.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">NHS culture at Mid Staffs that tolerated low standards and sold patients short</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>In answering the question of why hundreds of patients died needlessly at the Mid Staffordshire trust in the years between 2005 and 2009, Robert Francis QC, the barrister specialising in the NHS and medical negligence who chaired the public inquiry, has identified a culprit: the NHS culture, which focused "on doing the system's business – not that of the patients".</p>
								<p>A sharp legal brain, Francis has in four volumes and almost 2,000 pages cleverly side-stepped the need for a system overhaul to avoid the disastrous failures of those three years.</p>
								<p>Instead, he focuses on a system reset with better warning signals, greater accountability of senior managers and leaves NHS staff facing possible criminal prosecution if they are not open and honest about mistakes.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">'No more Mid Staffs' sounds so simple. It will be anything but</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>Any visitor who looked in on the House of Commons today during the key exchanges at prime minister's questions, and who then returned to hear the same protagonists debating the Stafford hospital report less than half an hour later, might have wondered what drugs David Cameron and Ed Miliband had been taking in their absence.</p>
								<p>The contrast would have been comical if the issues were not so important. At PMQs, where they traded blows on housing benefit, no insult was too cheap and no partisan caricature too crude. Yet in the debate about Robert Francis's final report on the horrendous failures at Stafford hospital, the leaders fell over themselves to compliment one another on their wisdom, tone and sensitivity. Suddenly, consensus was all.</p>
								<p>Surveys repeatedly show that the public much prefers politicians to agree and work together rather than knock six bells out of one another. That's why the coalition was so popular when it was formed and why, even now, another one might get the public vote again. Not a PMQs goes by without Speaker Bercow hogging the microphone to remind MPs how much voters hate the political bearpit. So, by that token, the public would have loathed PMQs and loved the civilised debate on Stafford hospital that followed.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs scandal: NHS faces another bout of initiative-itis</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>An NHS that Robert Francis QC rightly said had suffered from constant upheaval must now prepare for yet another bout of initiative-itis, all in the name of patient safety, which he identified as one of the victims of previous shakeup mania.</p>
								<p>Ironically, though, the architect of the changes that will result from the public inquiry he chaired into the Mid Staffs scandal will be our learned friend himself, and not a health secretary ordering a crackdown on this or that latest NHS problem.</p>
								<p>Many of Francis's 290 recommendations to ensure "fundamental change" are certainly eye-catching. Doctors, nurses and hospital managers could be prosecuted for either harming or killing a patient or not owning up to blunders that affect a patient's health. Whole units of hospitals could be shut down if serious concern emerges about the care they deliver. Hospitals should no longer be able to use gagging clauses to muzzle employees when they leave.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Overworked NHS nurses not to blame for Mid Staffs scandal</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>Rarely are the findings of a public inquiry the subject of more debate, speculation and commentary than those into the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. The inquiry heard from more than 160 witnesses over two years, and yesterday Robert Francis, who led the inquiry, delivered 290 recommendations that spell out how we can put patients at the very heart of the NHS and the care they receive.</p>
								<p>We at the Royal College of Nursing welcome yesterday's report. The government, NHS leaders, regulators and in fact everyone working to deliver care must read it in detail and consider how they will respond to all of Francis's recommendations. Something very wrong happened at this hospital and while no report will ever undo the appalling events that took place, there are very clear lessons to be learned.</p>
								<p>We are particularly pleased that Robert Francis has called for the registration and regulation of healthcare assistants. The NHS could not operate without the hundreds of thousands of support workers who deliver care to patients in hospitals, care homes and the community. However, we know that for many the training can be minimal. A consistent, mandatory system of regulation is the only way to ensure that concerns about performance and conduct are tackled and we would urge the government to act on this recommendation as soon as possible.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Stafford hospital victims' families say report does not go far enough</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>Sue Williams-Ashford, whose husband Ernie Ashford died at Stafford hospital in August 2008, was unimpressed by Robert Francis's verdict and recommendations.</p>
								<p>"I think some of the recommendations are somewhat pathetic," she said. "Zero tolerance in patient care should be a given, and I think his recommendation that people could be made criminals as a result of actions they have taken could be very dubious. It could have a detrimental effect on recruitment to the health service."</p>
								<p>As for a new system of inspection for hospitals: "Throwing money at something is not always a solution. You need the right management in place, the right executives in place. Leadership comes from the top."</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffordshire NHS trust inquiry report published</a></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The Francis report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust scandal, which led to the deaths of between 400 and 1,200 people, has recommended that causing death or harm to a patient should be a criminal offence. There should be more powers to suspend or prosecute boards and individuals, the report’s author, Robert Francis, recommended.</li>
								<li>A “duty of candour” should be imposed on NHS staff, the report said. Every healthcare organisation and everyone working for them must be honest, open and truthful in all their dealings with patients and the public, and organisational and personal interests must never be allowed to outweigh the duty to be honest, open and truthful.</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<ul>
									<li>A single regulator for financial and care quality should be introduced, Francis said. There should be a single regulator dealing both with corporate governance, financial competence, viability and compliance with patient safety, and with quality standards for all trusts.</li>
									<li>David Cameron formally apologised for the care scandal at Stafford hospital and announced immediate moves to improve patient care, increase accountability of hospitals and tackle a culture of “complacency” in the National Health Service. He proposed establishing the new post of chief inspector of hospitals.</li>
									<li>Campaigner Julie Bailey shrugged off Francis’s insistence that no individual should be made a “scapegoat” by the report by calling for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to step down.  The Unite union agreed. But Cameron said Nicholson had apologised, implying that was sufficient. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said it felt "wrong" that nobody had been brought to book over the failings at Stafford hospital.</li>

								<p>Robert Francis QC stressed that his report did not conform to the tradition of blaming and sacking individuals or proposing yet another shake-up of the health service's organisational architecture.</p>
								<p>"What has been found to be wrong here cannot be cured by finding scapegoats, and/or recommending major re-organisations yet again," Francis said.</p>
								<p>Nevertheless, his report examined "what each organisation knew, or should have known which might have been expected to give cause for concern or further inquiry, and to what extent, if any, action as taken to address these concerns".</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs scandal: Cameron apologises and vows to tackle NHS 'complacency'</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>The prime minister has formally apologised for the care scandal at the Mid Staffordshire NHS hospital trust and announced immediate moves to improve patient care, increase accountability of hospitals and tackle a culture of "complacency" in the NHS.</p>
								<p>Among the fast-tracked reforms were proposals that hospital boards could be suspended for ongoing serious care failures; an element of performance-related pay for nurses would be introduced; a new chief inspector of hospitals modelled on the Ofsted inspection agency for schools; and an inquiry into hospitals with the highest mortality rates nationwide.</p>
								<p>David Cameron made the statement in the House of Commons after Robert Francis QC published his report into the institutional and structural failings in the NHS that allowed a catalogue of horrific incidents to occur from 2005-2009, despite complaints from patients, families and staff members.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Francis report shows NHS is not the national treasure we thought it was</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>At last it has arrived. Robert Francis QC's long-awaited report has been published, passing excoriating criticism of almost all of the main institutions that make up the management, organisation and regulation of the NHS, and how their collective failure prolonged the suffering of hundreds of patients attending Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust and their families.</p>
								<p>For those in the upper echelons of the NHS, the temptation may be to defend the service's record, point out how the diagnosis is wrong in some way and explain that all pertinent lessons have been learnt and improvements already made. This would, however, represent a profound failure to understand the core message of the Francis Report, namely that within parts of the NHS, dignity, care and compassion are routinely absent from the care of patients.</p>
								<p>The NHS is often regarded as a national treasure, so central to the British identity that it merited a leading role in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. Indeed, compared with many other health care systems, the NHS stands out as offering universal care, free of charge, from cradle to grave.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs report: NHS culture was the culprit</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>In answering the question of why hundreds of patients died needlessly at the Mid Staffordshire trust in the years between 2005 and 2008, Robert Francis QC has identified a culprit: the NHS's culture, which focused "on doing the system's business – not that of the patients".</p>
								<p>A sharp legal brain, Francis has in four volumes and almost 2,000 pages cleverly side-stepped the need for a system overhaul to avoid the disastrous failures of those three years.</p>
								<p>Instead he focuses on a system reset with better warning signals, criminal penalties for not acting on breaches of fundamental standards and greater accountability of senior managers.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs report calls for sweeping changes to improve patient safety</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>Hospital staff and managers should face prosecution if patients are harmed or killed as a result of poor care as part of sweeping changes to finally end the NHS's neglect of patient safety, the landmark report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal has recommended.</p>
								<p>The report by Robert Francis QC, who chaired the 31-month public inquiry into the scandal, amounted to a damning indictment of NHS attitudes, practices and organisations.</p>
								<p>Francis made no fewer than 290 recommendations, which he said were designed to ensure that patients' interests became the top priority for the NHS and that in future any lapses in care standards are detected and stopped right away, unlike at Stafford hospital.</p>

							<h3><a href="#">Mid Staffs: heads must roll</a></h3>
							<!-- <div class="dwell">
								<p>In the findings of the Mid Staffs public inquiry I hope to see accountability for the hundreds of unnecessary deaths at Stafford hospital between 2005 and 2009.</p>
								<p>The report from Robert Francis QC, published today, needs to send a clear signal that we can't have 400 to 1,200 people dying needlessly as a result of poor care and treatment without the resignation of key people who were running the NHS. Heads must roll – and those responsible must never again be allowed to hold public office. Sir David Nicholson, former NHS chief executive and now head of the NHS commissioning board, needs to resign. All these deaths at Stafford hospital were happening under his nose.</p>
								<p>You only had to open a ward door at the hospital to smell the stench of urine, hear patients screaming in pain and see staff being bullied, and know that the care was appalling. But the people in charge chose not to do that.</p>
