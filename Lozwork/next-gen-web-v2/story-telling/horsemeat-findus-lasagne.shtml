			<p>The Food Standards Agency has ordered all British companies to test their processed beef products in the next week after analysis of lasagne made by Findus found up to 100% of the meat came from horses.</p>
			<p>Catherine Brown, the chief executive of the FSA, described the situation as appalling and said it seemed likely to have happened through deliberate fraud or other criminal activity, rather than mistaken contamination.</p>

			<div id="more-ny-minute" class="dwell">
				<p>The deadline for companies to have completed the tests is next Friday, the FSA said in a statement.</p>
				<p>The agency tested 18 supposedly beef-based processed lasagne dishes made by Findus, the latest food supplier to be caught up in a crisis that has affected firms in Ireland, France, Poland and Britain, and found 11 of them contained between 60% and 100% horsemeat.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland says beefburgers with traces of equine DNA, including one product classed as 29% horse, are being supplied to supermarkets by Silvercrest Foods in Ireland and Dalepak Hambleton in Yorkshire, subsidiaries of the ABP Food Group.</p>
			<p>Ten million burgers are taken off the shelves, by retailers including Tesco, Lidl, Aldi, Iceland and Dunnes Stores.</p>
			<div class="dwell">
				<p>A third company, Liffey meats, based in County Cavan, Ireland, is also found to be supplying products to supermarkets with traces of horse DNA.</p>
				<p>The ABP Food Group suspends work at its Silvercrest Foods plant in County Monaghan, Ireland, until further notice.</p>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<!-- <h3><a href="#">What the horsemeat scandal and fish quotas tell us about Europe</a></h3> -->
			<p>The scandal of horsemeat – its being declared as beef and smuggled across borders and then into processed food – is sweeping Europe. According to the Financial Times a few days ago, the process involved "horse meat from a Romanian abattoir being sold to a French supplier by way of a Cypriot trader, and then passed on to a French food processing company before landing on British and French supermarket shelves". Since then the "horseplay" has spread to Germany and from beefburgers to lasagne.</p>
			<p>What needs to be recognised beyond all the immediate hullabaloo is that the scandal shows just how illusory it is to imagine that Europe can function as a "common market" without all the red tape and constraints on sacred national sovereignty that Eurosceptics so ferociously decry. Production for the market requires regulation. And if we want to enjoy the benefits of a highly developed international division of labour – and they are real – then we need agreement on common rules between the trading partners.</p>
			<div class="dwell">
				<p>Now, in principle, such rules could be established without pooling sovereignty. All you have to do is to get a legitimate representative of 27 countries to sign up to a common set of rules and have it ratified by 27 sovereign national parliaments. It is just that you then give each country a veto and a huge temptation to use it to play strategic games with the other 26 trading partners. And every time circumstances change, you need to get the 27 representatives together and to agree again. Such intergovernmentalism does not look likely to generate efficient solutions. And that is what you need to remember the next time you read about EU regulations running to thousands of pages. Even then you are not done: what happens if a country fails to apply the common rules? If they are to have any clout, supranational elements will certainly be necessary in the area of enforcement. All of which shows how fatuous it is to criticise, on principle, supranational meddling in national affairs and the associated loss of national sovereignty. (And no, this does not, of course, mean, that everything that Brussels imposes on member states is beyond reproach.)</p>
				<p>The recent debate on the EU budget also clearly shows the limits of intergovernmentalism. Wherever unanimity is required, things rapidly descend into a zero-sum scrap in which national politicians are rated according to how successfully they have bullied their partners, and even serious newspapers score the event like a 27-way boxing match: Cameron – winner!; Merkel – winner!; Hollande – loser! The problem is that this obscures the real news, which is that the outcome is a budget plan that is completely illogical from the point of view of rationally addressing the challenges faced by European citizens.</p>

				<h3><a href="#">Burger King admits horse contamination</a></h3>
				<img src="/img/5x3.png" />
				<p>Fast food retailer Burger King has been forced to place advertisements in the national press in response to a growing backlash from customers, after it admitted some of its burgers were contaminated in the horsemeat scandal.</p>
				<p>Burger King placed advertisements in the Sun, Express, Mirror, Star and Times newspapers, apologising to customers for the "very small trace levels" of horse DNA found in four samples at Burger King's Irish supplier, Silvercrest. Burgers taken from restaurants, however, had tested negative.</p>
				<div class="dwell">
					<p>DNA testing and other inquires are continuing in Poland, where a supplier used by Silvercrest is thought to be the source of the contamination. Jaroslaw Naze, Poland's deputy veterinary officer, said a sixth slaughterhouse was now under investigation after it was identified on the labelling of meat under investigation in Ireland. DNA testing carried out in five other slaughterhouses has so far shown no traces of horse protein.</p>
					<p>The day after Burger King admitted its involvement in the horsemeat scandal, customers at its outlet on London's Euston Road expressed concern at the news. Emilie Ashen said: "It grosses me out. I don't want to be eating horse meat if I'm not told about it – I don't think I'd want to eat horse meat even if I was told about it to be honest."</p>
