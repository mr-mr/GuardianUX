					<li>Links within the results go to match reports or the PA supplied live text commentary if no match report - see match report section for more details.</li>
					<li>Links within tables go to club section/keyword pages where available.</li>
					<li>Links contained within the More statistics module are contextual - links on All results/fixtures go to other 'All' pages, links on competition pages go to other statistics for that competition and links on club pages go to other statistics for that club.</li>
					<li>The current statistic page isn't shown in the module, e.g. when on a fixtures page, fixtures is not shown as a link.

Volume states should be addressed as part of the visual design, based on the work done on importance during discovery week (i.e. <a href="http://guardian.lab7.co.uk/volume-control.shtml">various volume states</a>).</p>

				<ul id="network-front-notes" class="show-hide">
					<li>Stories are taken from all the top level zones present in mobile: News, Sport, Comment, Culture, Business, Life &amp; Style, Money and Travel.</li>
					<li>Each section can be shown and hidden. Hidden sections are stored in a cookie (and user account?) so when a user returns this sections are still hidden (this should work in the wireframe).</li>
					<li>There are two additional sections, features and most read/watched.</li>
					<li>The features area is a carousel consisting of three pages of three articles. <strong>N.B.</strong> The carousel doesn't work in the wireframe.</li>
					<li>I've mocked the articles up similar to the impact trails, i.e. the idea being that there could be a picture in the background, with link text on top. Either way the features should be treated visually different to the rest of the page.	</li>
					<li>There are five stories from news and sport, with five shown and hidden via a show more link (with article count). The five that are shown have picture (if present), link text and trail text. The five that are hidden initially are shown with only link text.</li>
					<li>Likewise there are three stories from Comment is free, with three shown and hidden via a show more link (with article count). All stories in this section show a linking quote of some kind, with the author name.</li>
					<li>The three initially shown comment stories have some form of byline picture instead of an article picture</li>
					<li>For the three that are shown, the whole block should link (you'll notice that it is in the wireframe).</li>
					<li>The remaining sections (Comment, Culture, Business, Life &amp; Style, Money and Travel) one article per section is shown. This consists of picture (if present), link text and trail text.</li>
					<li>Business has an additional live element for market data.</li>
					<li>At certain times, during match days, or big sporting events, sport should also have a live area. This isn't shown but will come out of the work to be done on sport statistics.</li>
					<li><strong>N.B.</strong> There are no sublinks. Sublinks should only be shown on really big stories, upto a maximum of three.</li>
					<li><strong>N.B. </strong> I'd still like to test a version of the below that shows the first four paragraphs of any story linked in this page (via a simple show and hide), with a more link to view the full article.</li>

				<h2>Articles</h2>
				<p>This illustrates an article with a story package, but the rules should be the same for both story packages and related content.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/article">Article page</a> - showing story package and popular content at the end of the article.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Notes <span><a href="#show-hide" class="show-hide">Show</a></span></h3>
				<ul id="show-hide" class="show-hide">
					<li>Added in body video (just a placeholder), and a gallery <strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The gallery carousel bit under the large image wont work, but if you click an image it will launch the gallery <strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>Added article history, on show hide <strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>Added correct navigation and footer <strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>If there is no story package, related links should be shown instead.</li>
					<li>Story packages/related content/popular show a maximum of ten articles.</li>
					<li>The first five stories are shown, the second five are hidden with a 'show more' link.</li>
					<li>The first three of the five articles that are shown are displayed with picture, link text and trail text. <strong class="live-latest">Updated 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The next two are shown with link text and trail text. <strong class="live-latest">Updated 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The five articles that are hidden are displayed with only link text. <strong class="live-latest">Updated 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The 'show more' link should have a count of how many more stories are hidden.</li>
					<li>When the extra articles are shown, the 'show more' link text should change to say 'Hide'.</li>
					<li>The above rules also apply to the most popular module as well.</li>
					<li>All comments, bar one, are initially hidden to show the user the onward journeys (related links, story package) first. <strong class="live-latest">Updated 8 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The comment that is shown is the most recommended, falling back to the latest comment if there are no recommendations. <strong class="live-latest">New 8 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>This comment will only show X amount of characters/words with an ellipses at the end to indicate that there is more. The ellipses should link to the comment in question. <strong>N.B.</strong> if this link is tapped it will show comments. However, in my implementation, this has a knockon effect meaning you need to click the 'hide comments' link twice - this shouldn't happen, it should still only require one click.</li>
					<li>The title above this shown comment should change to reflect whether it's 'Most recommended' or 'Latest' comment.</li>
					<li>When shown, the comments show in batches of 25.<strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
					<li>The user can chose to load in more comments by tapping the 'load next 25 comments' link <strong class="live-latest">New 7 Aug</strong></li>
