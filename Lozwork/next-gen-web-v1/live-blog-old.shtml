						<dt>75 min</dt>
						<dd>It's a fine line between intriguing and irritating. This match is starting to edge towardas the latter now. "This is putting me to sleep," yawns John Abbate. "I thought nothing could be more of a bore than tiki-taka, but I was mistaken: failed tiki-taka is far more of a snooze. Here's hoping for one quick successful CR7/Nani counter attack so we can call it a night."</dd>	
						<dt>73 min</dt>
						<dd>It's a reasonable effort from Ronaldo but it ever looked like going in. A couple of yards over.</dd>		
						<dt>72 min</dt>
						<dd>Busquets does the Ramos: deliberately blocking Ronaldo's run while making out that he is trying to get out of the way. The ref isn't fooled and awards Portugal a freekick. There is not a hope in hell of Ronaldo doing anything other than shooting from 28 yards.</dd>
						<dt>71 min</dt>
						<dd>Almeida is more useful at his own end of the pitch that in attack. he's just backtracked diligently to intercept an Alonso pass and nod it back to his keeper.</dd>
						<dt>69 min</dt>
						<dd>Another ridiculous shot by Almeida, who ignores Nani to his right to boom the ball wide from a silly angle.</dd>
						<dt>68 min</dt>
						<dd>Xavi skips clear from Meireles in midfield and ventures towards the box, before shooting from 25 yards. Easy save for the keeper.</dd>
						<dt>67 min</dt>
						<dd>Alonso tries to enliven proceedings with a shot from 50 yards. Wide it goes. "Portugal won't get tired," hammers Adam Hirst. "They're running around all the time. Everyone knows that standing on the edge of your own area in the Two Banks of Four is far more tiring. Takes more concentration see. How else can you explain the Best Midfielder in the World getting cramp after 55 minutes?"</dd>
						<dt>65 min</dt>
						<dd>Fabregas lays it off to Iniesta and then dashes into the box in search of the return, which he can't get because Pereira pulls him down. Freekick to Spain at the corner of the box. Xavi curls it in. Almeida heads it wide. Which he's quite good at.</dd>
						<dt>63 min</dt>
						<dd>Ramos rushes across to help out Alba after the winger threatened to get to the by-line.</dd>	
						<dt>61 min</dt>
						<dd>Pepe booked for a perfectly valid challenge on Alonso. This ref has been plod. And so has Silva, which is why he is now being replaced by Jesus Navas.</dd>	
						<dt>60 min</dt>
						<dd>Ronaldo surges down the right and into the box before collapsing in the vicinity of Ramos. Busquets seemingly complains that the Portuguese dived, and is duly booked for his brazenness.</dd>
						<dt>59 min</dt>
						<dd>Ronaldo slips the ball through to Almeida and sprints into position to receive it back ... but it doesn't come, as Almeida tries another wildly ambitious shot. Time to bring on Oliveira.</dd>
						<dt>57 min</dt>
						<dd>No, no, no! Portugal had a 3 v 3 attack. Almeida had the ball, with Ronaldo to his right and Nani to his left. So what does he do? He attempts to whack the ball into the top corner from 25 yards! With predictable consequences. If either of these sides had a striker, this game would have been far better.</dd>			
						<dt>56 min</dt>
						<dd>Tremendous work by Coentrao to win a corner for Portugal. Nani's delivery, however, was wretched.</dd>
