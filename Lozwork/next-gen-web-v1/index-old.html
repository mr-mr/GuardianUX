				<h2>Statistics</h2>
				<p>Will add to this section over the coming weeks.At present I am working to three scenarios, morning of a match day, during the live games, and then the evening of the matchday. Ignore content that is present on the pages, its just placeholders to show where the fixtures/scores/results would appear.</p>
				<p><strong>N.B.</strong> A few things to bear in mind (but aren't working yet, because I've only completed a few pages):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Team names always link to the team/club section/keyword page</li>
					<li>During live games, the scores should link to the live blog for that series of fixtures, i.e. if there is a single fixture the score will link to that games live blog. If there are multiple games, each score will link to the one live blog that is covering all the games. For the purposes of the demos, this links to the Live blog two example page from the live blog section below.</li>
					<li>Post game the score should link to the match report.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Statistics module</h3>
				<p>This shows how a statistics module could work on the sport section front.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport.shtml">Sport section front</a> - module contains any upcoming football fixtures, with links to other sport scores, fixtures and results. You'll need to scroll down to see the module.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Live scores, fixtures and results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="statistics-all-fixtures.shtml">All fixtures</a> - shows all fixtures for the coming week ahead. The user has the ability to filter this list by nation/competition (the filter doesn't work, but it should be obvious what it does), and also to load in another weeks worth of fixtures when they reach the bottom of the page.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Football section front</h3>
				<p>These are using the scenario of a Saturday during the premiership season. They should cover enough bases for application to other days of the week/competitions.</p>
				<p>There are some very basic rules on what is shown where within the list of games. The priority order should be Live, fixtures then results. This allows live games to always be at the top of the list. I've explained this in more detail below.</p>
				<ul>
					<!-- <li><a href="statistics-sport-am.shtml">Sport section front on morning of matchday</a> - fixtures are promoted at the top of the index, with the first three shown. Were there a single fixture, then just that would be shown.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-lunch-live.shtml">Sport section front during lunchtime kick off</a> - one live score with fixtures also displayed. Score is sticky.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-afternoon-live.shtml">Sport section front during afternoon kick offs</a> - this has live scores, results and fixtures. The live scores are sticky.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-five-pm.shtml">Sport section front post afternoon games</a> - As the 17:30 game hasn't kicked off, there are just fixtures and one result.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-evening-live.shtml">Sport section front during evening kick off</a> - similar to the first page, replacing the fixtures with results. Score is sticky.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-ten-pm.shtml">Sport section front post evening game</a> - showing saturday's results and sunday's fixtures.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-sport-live.shtml">Sport section front during live games (all games, i.e. last day of premiership)</a> - scores are top and would auto update, and as per fixtures can be expanded and contracted. When the page is scrolled the scores become sticky similar to the live blog page – this is buggy, and more than one score will be shown. The idea is to only show one at a time. The switch to turn off auto update doesn't work, but it should be fairly obviously what it does.</li>
					<li><a href="statistcs-sport-results.shtml">Sport section after all fixtures have finished</a> - scores/fixtures are replaced by results.</li> -->
					<li><a href="statistics-football-am.shtml">Football section front on the morning of matchday</a> - all games are upcoming fixtures so they appear in the list as normal.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-lunch-live.shtml">Football section front during lunchtime kick off</a> - the first fixture in the list becomes live, with the score linking to the live blog for this game. The kick off time changes to indicate which stage the game is at (1st, HT, 2nd, ET, PEN, FT).</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-afternoon-live.shtml">Football section front during 3pm kick offs</a> - the Chelsea game is now a result, and so drops to the end of the list, allowing the 3pm kick offs, now live, to be shown first. The scores for the 3pm kick offs link to the multi game live blog, and kick off times change as above.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-five-pm.shtml">Football section front at 5pm</a> - The 3pm kick offs have finished, but the 5.30 game has yet to start. As the 3pm games are now results, they drop to the bottom of the list, and the 5pm fixture is shown top as there are no other live games.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-evening-live.shtml">Football section front during 5.30pm kick off</a> - The final fixture of the day now becomes live, with the score linking to the live blog for this game, and the kick off time changing as above.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-results.shtml">Football section front evening/night</a> - All games have been played and are now results. This should shown at the top for a period of time, before dropping down the section front.</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-facup.shtml">Football section front the morning of FA Cup third round</a> - This is to show what it would look like if we included all the major fixtures for the day. FA Cup third round is the most fixtures we'll have, with 32 (and that's assuming all play on the Saturday which wont happen as they're usually spread over the weekend).</li>
					<li><a href="statistics-football-mixed-fix.shtml">Football section front showing multiple competition fixtures</a> - later on in the season when the FA Cup and Champions League reach their latter stages, league games or Cup replays can be played alongside other these competitions. The acronym to the left indicates competition.</li>
				<p>The live/fixtures/results module is intended to be flexibile in it's positioning, i.e. it shouldn't always be top. My initial thoughts are that it should be top of the page from the get go on Saturday's, somewhere further down initially on Sundays - Thursdays. On Sunday it should go top at around 11am and Mon-Thurs it should move to the top around 2pm/3pm. Fridays I don't think there are any significant fixtures (i.e. Prem, FA Cup, UEFA), though there might be the odd FA Cup game.</p>
				<p>It would be good if the positioning were automated, with an overide (i.e. if something significant happens, player dies etc, we can lead with that, rather than the fixtures module).</p>
				</ul>

				<h2>Live blogs/pages</h2>
				<p>Slight update here as I've removed the pull to refresh version, which will be replaced presently. Stats have been massaged to show 50/50 styling and any tables and galleries are placeholders whilst we find out if we can do them (more so the gallery - this is intended to be automated from whatever picture provider Guardian uses.).</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="live-blog-one.shtml">Version one</a> - Auto updating, with switch to turn off. If a user turns it off a notification appears showing the amount of updates that have been missed. The last 20 minutes (arbitary, we could make it ten or fifteen) are shown by default, with a 'load more' option which loads in the previous 20 minutes and so on. Finally, the score will appear if you scroll down, fixed to the top. The idea here is that this live updates as well, so you can see when a goal has gone in if you are halfway down the page.</li>
					<li><a href="live-blog-two.shtml">Version two</a> - as above but for multiple games. The scores are shown when you scroll down the page, but cylce between all games –  this aspect is a bit shakey, but you get the idea (it's supposed to reset to the first fixture if you scroll right to the top and scroll down again, but it doesn't quite work). You can also see more detail (i.e. scorers and cards) on the scores tab.</li>
					<li><a href="live-blog-three.shtml">Version three</a> - single game, with pull to refresh. No sticky scores when you scroll on this version as it interferes with the pull to refresh from a UX perspective when you scroll up and down. Statistics and the table are off canvas, revealed with either taps/clicks or swipes left/right. This obviously only works if we don't use this method for the navigation.</li>
					<li><a href="live-blog-four.shtml">Version four</a> - as above but for multiple games. Statistics is replaced by scores</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Navigation</h2>
				<p>Three variants on navigation</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="navigation-one.shtml">Navigation test one</a> - pretty much as now. I've kept similar positioning, but the two triggers to reveal the navigation could equally be icons positioned on the right, level with the logo.</li>
					<li><a href="navigation-two.shtml">Navigation test two</a> - all navigation positioned after the content (probably using JS for this as it will more than likely need to be at the top for larger screens). The good thing about this is that placing it here gives a user options at the end of every page. As pervious, the two anchor links at the top could be icons or text in the final design.</li>
					<li><a href="navigation-three.shtml">Navigation test three</a> - riffing off the Financial Times app and what people like the Boston Globe and The Times are doing. The sections/search areas still open up, but the sections navigation also surfaces content, whilst the search navigation shows recent search terms. This would probably have to be contextual, so as you navigated deeper into the site, the sections would change to, for example, the sport sections (with the link to show/hide the sections changing to 'sport sections' to reflect this).</li>
					<li><a href="navigation-four.shtml">Navigation test four</a> - off canvas, Facebook/Twitter app style navigation. This should also be swipeable (left/right), might be a bit buggy. The fallback for no JS support/less capable browsers would be to have the navigation at the bottom (similar to version two basically). This demo is really quick and dirty so there are a few things wrong with it, such as content and nav butting up together, the trigger button being on the right rather than the left etc.</li>

				<h2>Article story packages, related content, tags/keywords and most read</h2>
				<p>Some illustrations of what we could do with story packages, related content, tags and most read, and combinations thereof.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="article-elements.shtml">Two from four: Story package (limited to 10, 5 shown, 5 hidden) with most read</a></li>
					<li><a href="article-elements-too.shtml">Two from four: Tags/Keywords (limited to 10, 5 shown, 5 hidden, if less than 10 have remainder after 5 hidden, if less than 5 just show what there is) with most read</a></li>
					<li><a href="article-elements-three.shtml">Three from four: Story package (limited to 10, 5 shown, 5 hidden), three tags/keywords and most read. The same would work for Related links, but this isn't shown.</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Network fronts</h2>
				<p>Experiments with the network front.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="network-front.shtml">Version 1</a> – Taking what is existing/the top ten sections and expanding the content to include pictures for all stories, sublinks for the first five stories, show and hide sections, show and hide more (would be done via javascript call to pull in extra items).</li>
					<li><a href="network-front-too.shtml">Version 2</a> – Using the zones present in mobile to build a front page (e.g. showing stories from each zone) with Most read and Zeitgeist at the bottom. Show and hide more stories available (would be done via javascript call to pull in extra items).</li>
					<li><a href="network-front-three.shtml">Version 3</a> – Distinct Top stories, Sport and comment areas, one story from other sections and a features block between the two.</li>
					<li><a href="network-front-four.shtml">Version 4</a> – content from all 19 of the top sections (taken from a year of site catalyst data). Major sections (i.e. those most popular) have five stories, median have three, and smaller sections have one story. All the major and median secitons have a show hide control. I've used real content here as it made no sense without it.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			<article class="secondary-story">
				<h2>News 'tiles' and 'volume'</h2>
				<p>Playing with visual presentation (though these still wireframes, not designs) and 'volume' of a story/stories</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="volume-one-tiles.shtml">Version 1, tiles</a> - normal news day, with three top stories. <a href="volume-one-type.shtml">Fall back/type only version 1</a></li>
					<li><a href="volume-two-tiles.shtml">Version 2, tiles</a> - large event, e.g. budget. <a href="volume-two-type.shtml">Fall back/type only version 2</li>
					<li><a href="volume-three-tiles.shtml">Version 3, tiles</a> - two large stories/unplanned events, e.g. Cameron resigns on the day England win Euro 2012. <a href="volume-three-type.shtml">Fall back/type only version 3</li>
					<li><a href="volume-four-tiles.shtml">Version 4, tiles</a> - terror attack/large unplanned event, e.g. September 11, 2001. <a href="volume-four-type.shtml">Fall back/type only version 4</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Volume control</h3>
				<p>Taking Matt's idea and visualising it on a linear level. Slider controls the volume of a story, with or without pictures.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="volume-control.shtml">Volume control</a></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>All content test</h2>
				<p>The aim of this is to see how all the current network front content feels on a small screened device. It's not intended to be anything other than an experiment and a starting point for discussion – we can use this as a 'straw man' (bleugh) to decide what we think of the length/types of content we currently have and whether we want all of this going forward (for any device).</p>
				<ul class="releated-items">
					<li><a href="current-desktop-as-mobile.html">All content on small devices</a></li>
					<li><a href="current-desktop.html">Current desktop site</a></li>
					<li><a href="current-mobile.html">Current mobile site</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Caveats</h3>
				<p>As ever, there's a few things to bear in mind:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There are no, repeat no, adverts on the experiment (or any other similar content). Clearly this isn't going to be the case with the finished result – it was merely a time saving measure.</li>
					<li>Adverts on the current versions might either not appear or appear a bit odd.</li>
					<li>It'll only work in Chrome and Safari, probably Firefox/Fennec and possibly Opera/Opera mini.</li>
					<li>This isn't, and I can't stress this enough, a design. The styling and 'design' of it is rudimentary and it's intended as an experimental wireframe that we can tear apart and nothing more.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Type tests</h2>
				<p>Some small typographic tests to assess styles, sizes and spacing. Also experimenting with using the actual Guardian typeface, as used in the iPad app.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="type-test.html">Type test using Georgia and Helvetica</a></li>
					<li><a href="type-test-too.html">Type test using Guardian Egyptian and Helvetica</a></li>
					<li><a href="type-test-three.html">As above, with in body more on this story.</a></li>
