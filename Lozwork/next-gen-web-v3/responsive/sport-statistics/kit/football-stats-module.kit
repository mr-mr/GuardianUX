		<h1>Football fixtures &amp; results module</h1>

		<h2>Order of priority</h2>
		<p>The competition order of priority for football fixtures/results is currently as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		   <li>Champions League</li>
		   <li>Champions League Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>Europa League</li>
		   <li>Europe League Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>Premier League</li>
		   <li>FA Cup</li>
		   <li>FA Cup preliminary rounds</li>
		   <li>Championship</li>
		   <li>Scottish Premiership</li>
		   <li>127?????</li>
		   <li>Capital One Cup</li>
		   <li>Community Shield</li>
		   <li>Scottish Cup/Scottish League cup – these share the same ID but they are not the same competition – scottish cup refers to the Scottish FA Cup</li>
		   <li>World Cup 2014 Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>La Liga</li>
		   <li>League One</li>
		   <li>League Two</li>
		   <li>Scottish Championship</li>
		   <li>Scottish League Cup</li>
		   <li>Scottish League One</li>
		   <li>Scottish League Two</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Pre-programmed overrides and exceptions</h2>
		<p>there should be the option for us to add games additional games, from separate competitions, to the fixtures/results module for any given day if it is a game we care about.</p>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>An Old Firm (Celtic v Rangers) or El Clasico (Barcelona v Real Madrid) game on the same day as some Premier League fixtures</li>
			<li>FA Cup replays or Champions League game on same day as other major competition</li>
			<li>League Cup final, FA Cup final on same day as other major competition</li>			
		</ul>

		<h2>International exceptions</h2>
		<p>Home nation (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland) or Republic of Ireland fixtures should appear on the Sport front. Where these are part of a larger batch of fixtures, only the home nation/Republic of Ireland fixtures should appear.</p>
		<p>When any home nation or Republic of Ireland plays an international friendly, this should trump any other international qualifying games unless another home nation or Republic of Ireland is involved in those international qualifying games.</p>

		<h3>Example one</h3>
		<p>England are playing Spain in a friendly, none of the other home nations are playing, but there is a full round of World Cup Qualifiers being played.</p>
		<p>The England Game should be displayed in the fixtures/results module.</p>

		<h3>Example two</h3>
		<p>England are playing Brazil in a friendly, but Scotland are playing France in a European Championship play off. There is also other European Championship play of games staking place, that do not involve any of the remaining home nations</p>
		<p>The Scotland game, and any other play off games are shown in the fixtures/results module.</p>

		<h2>Fixtures and results module</h2>
		<p>Fixtures and results become linked – one or the other is shown dependant on time of day and day of week.</p>
		<p>Assuming tabs/accordion in fixtures/results module:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>During weekdays (Mon-Fri) previous days results are shown as the open tab/accordion pane until midday, before lunchtime spike</li>
			<li>During weekends (Sat-Sun), previous days results are shown as the open tab/accordion pane open until 10am.</li>
			<li>After the above times, the current day's fixtures becomes the default, open tab/accordion pane.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How many matches to show</h2>
		<p>We should show the five matches on all section fronts at smaller screen sizes, with option to show/hide more. If there are six matches we should show them all, but seven would have a show/hide more link.</p>
		<p>Larger screens should show all fixtures up to a maximum of 12, with show/hide more after that. Should there be 13 matches, we would show all 13, but 14 would have a show/hide more link.</p>

		<h2>Minor fixtures/results</h2>
		<p>One of the original problems the new module was supposed to solve was occasions where screen real estate was taken by minor games, i.e. York vs Accrington Stanley.</p>
		<p>In these instances we will not show the module at all.</p>

		<h2>Sport vs Football section fronts</h2>
		<p>Within the priority list of competitions, there is a subsection that should appear on both Sport and Football section fronts, or just on Football section fronts. The following will appear on both:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Champions League</li>
			<li>Europa League</li>
			<li>Premier League</li>
			<li>FA Cup</li>
			<li>Charity Shield</li>
			<li><em>Home nation/Republic of Ireland international games</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>(italics denotes addition to current)</em></p>
		<p>The following will only appear on football:</p>
		<ul>
		   <li>Champions League Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>Europa League Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>Championship</li>
		   <li>Scottish Premiership</li>
		   <li>127?</li>
		   <li>Capital One Cup</li>
		   <li>Community Shield</li>
		   <li>Scottish Cup/Scottish League cup – these share the same ID but they are not the same competition – Scottish cup refers to the Scottish FA Cup</li>
		   <li>World Cup 2014 Qualifiers</li>
		   <li>La Liga</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The rest will not appear if they are the only league or competition to take place on any given day.</p>
