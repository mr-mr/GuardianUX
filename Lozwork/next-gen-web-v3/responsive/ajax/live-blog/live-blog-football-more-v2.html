		<p>Brilliant by Navas, who activates the burners to scorch past two defenders and into the box ... and then plils it back, just behind a team-mate. Desperate defending by Italy scrambles it away. The crowd are whistling for flil-time, believing that Italy deserve a crack at victory in the shootout!</p>
