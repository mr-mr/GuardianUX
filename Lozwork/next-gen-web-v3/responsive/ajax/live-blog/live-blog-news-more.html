			<p>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, says today's report will have left people "stunned".</p>
			<p>Labour echoes the apology, he says.</p>
			<p>People accept that mistakes get made. But trying to cover up mistakes is inexcusable.</p>
			<p>He pays tribute to the family of Joshua Titcombe, the baby who died at Furness general hospital's maternity unit. Without them, these revelations would never have come out, he says.</p>
			<p>Burnham asks Hunt if he is confident that the cover-up at CQC is no longer happening.</p>
			<p>Is anyone involved in the original decision to delete the critical report still working at the CQC, or in the NHS?</p>
			<p>Was anyone at the Department for Health aware of the deleted report? And was anyone at the department involved in the decision to delete it?</p>
			<p>A whistleblower on the board raised concerns. There was then an attempt to remove her. Were ministers involved in this?</p>

			<p>Hunt says what happened to families at Universities Hospital Morecambe Bay was a tragedy.</p>
			<p>He says he wants to apologise to those families.</p>
			<p>What the Care Quality Commission did was totally unacceptable.</p>
			<p>But there is now new leadership, he says.</p>
			<p>David Prior was appointed chairman in January. He insisted the report into the cover-up was published as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>He wants to turn it into a fearless regulator.</p>
			<p>Prior will report back to Hunt on what action he is taking, including internal disciplinary proceedings.</p>
