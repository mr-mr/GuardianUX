		<h1>Wireframe documentation</h1>		
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>This doc provides a brief overview of the HTML wireframes produced so far for the Next Gen Web project. Chris Clarke and Stephen Hellens are the people to ask if you have any questions. Failing that, feel free to <a href="mailto:loz.gray@lab7.co.uk?subject=Guardian%20Wireframes">drop me an email</a>.</p>
		
		<h2>Necessary applications</h2>
		<p>You'll need a suite of four apps, with two being prescriptive:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A text editor for markup</li>
			<li>An FTP client</li>
			<li>Codekit</li>
			<li>MAMP</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>The text editor and FTP client can be your personal choice (most UXers have Textmate and Transmit respectively), however Codekit and MAMP are required.</p>

		<h2>Codekit setup</h2>
		<p><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> compiles and minifies the languages used to build the wireframes. You add projects, and frameworks, and code kit does the rest (more on this later).</p>
		<p>You'll need to make a few minor changes to the out of the box preferences to ensure it works with the HTML wireframes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Preferences > General</strong> – check that 'localhost:8888' is present within the auto-reload browsers text field.</li>
			<li><strong>Preferences > Languages > LESS > Output Paths</strong> – If it's not already, select the 'to this path' option, and type '../css' in the text box. 'Relative to' should already be set to 'The folder that contains the source file'.</li>
			<li><strong>Preferences > Languages > SASS > Output Paths</strong> – If it's not already, select the 'to this path' option, and type '../css' in the text box. 'Relative to' should already be set to 'The folder that contains the source file'.</li>
			<li><strong>Preferences > Languages > JS > Language Options</strong> – The default Codekit minification adds '.ck' to filenames. Change this to the more standard '.min'.</li>
			<li><strong>Preferences > Languages > JS > Output Paths</strong> – If it's not already, select the 'to this path' option, and type '../js' in the text box.  'Relative to' should already be set to 'The folder that contains the source file'.</li>
			<li><strong>Preferences > Languages > Kit > Output Paths</strong> – If it's not already, select the 'to this path' option, and type '../' in the text box.  'Relative to' should already be set to 'The folder that contains the source file'.</li>			
		</ul>
		<p><strong>N.B.</strong> One thing to bear in mind with Codekit is that it scans intermittently for new files, so you can sometimes end up trying to save a newly created file and not getting any output because Codekit hasn't scanned it yet. You can force Codekit to rescan for files at any time.</p>

		<h2>MAMP setup</h2>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP package</a> is basically a web server in a folder. There are two versions of MAMP: MAMP and MAMP Pro. You'll only need the normal, non-pro version.</p>
		<p>MAMP runs at <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a> and you can access this from any device on the same wireless network (e.g. your mobile/tablet) by replacing localhost with your IP address, e.g.:</p>
		<p>http://192.161.0.10:8888</p>
		<p>You can find your current IP address in System Preferences > Network.</p>
		<p>The document root (where web pages are served from) can be any folder you have access to on your Mac – just point MAMP at that folder.</p>
		<p>To change the document root, in MAMP, go Preferences > Apache and select the required folder.</p>

		<h2>UX server</h2>
		<p>At the time of writing there is an Amazon Server Instance that UX use to house their documents. The server address is:</p>
		<p><a href="ec2-54-216-211-160.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com">ec2-54-216-211-160.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</a></p>
		<p>With username:</p>
		<p>Ubuntu</p>
		<p>There there is no password on the server, because access is limited to SSH keys. To enable you to have FTP access you need to open Terminal, type (or copy paste in) the following, then hit return:</p>
		<p><pre>ssh-keygen -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa; pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre></p>
		<p>This command will copy something to your clipboard. You need to paste that into an email and send it to Matt Chadburn and ask him nicely to sort out your permissions for the UX server.</p>
		<p>Once this is done, you can plug these details into your chosen FTP client and you should gain access.</p>
		<p>The /www is where all the files live. For the responsive track of work there are three folders:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>/www/next-gen-web-1</strong> – initial concept/experimentation stuff</li>
			<li><strong>/www/next-gen-web-2</strong> – older work</li>
			<li><strong>/www/next-gen-web-3</strong> – current thinking</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The second folder contains most of the things that made it into the November 2012 relaunch of m.guardian. There are still large parts of functionality here that didn't make it in, for whatever reason so it's worth perusing – breaking news would be a good example of this.</p>
		<p><srong>N.B.</srong> This server is temporary - you should work locally and upload to this server.</p>

		<h2>Languages</h2>
		<p>The HTML wireframes are built using:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Codekit's .kit files</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>LESS</li>			
		</ul>

		<h3>Codekit's .kit files</h3>
		<p>These are essentially just HTML files, but with two main benefits: includes and variables.</p>
		<p>Includes (like normal HTML server side includes) allow you to create fragments of reusable HTML, such as navigation and footers, and place them within other HTML documents. Unlike normal SSIs, you can also place an include _in_ an include. Codekit will parse all the includes and generate a flat .html file.</p>
		<p>Variables, as in any other language, allow you to define reusable bits of information. Variables can also work in tandem with includes, and can be passed between the two.</p>
		<p>Full documentation on .kit files can be found at <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php">http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Always, always, edit the '.kit' files instead of editing the outputted '.html' files. If you make changes to the HTML files, when you save anything Codekit will automatically recompile _the '.kit' files_ to HTML, overwriting your changes.</p>

		<h3>jQuery</h3>
		<p>The syntax of jQuery mirrors that of javascript, but it's easier to learn. It allows you to chain commands to traverse and change the document object model (DOM) of an HTML file.</p>
		<p>The API documentation is comprehensive with plenty of examples and, failing that, any question you have has likely been asked and answered on StackOverflow – remember Google is your friend here kids.</p>
		<p>Full documentation on jQuery can be found at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">http://api.jquery.com/</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Your text editor will highlight jQuery as if it were javascript which should work just fine.</p>

		<h3>LESS</h3>
		<p>These HTML wireframes were written using LESS. LESS and SASS are essentially the same, preprocessors for CSS that feature mixins, variables, colour functions and a whole host of other useful features that are too detailed to go into here, so take a look at <a href="http://lesscss.org/">the LESS homepage</a> for more info.</p>
		<p>As the front end team for next gen uses SASS (and, well, Compass), eventually the wireframes will migrate to SASS – hence getting you to tweak the preference for that as well in Codekit.</p>
		<p><strong>N.B.</strong> It's likely that your text editor will not highlight LESS files, or will try to highlight them as CSS. You'll need to find a plugin or bundle that highlights LESS. I use <a href="http://github.com/appden/less.tmbundle/">the one by Rasmus Andersson and Scott Kyle on github</a>.</p>

		<h2>Frameworks</h2>
		<p>The only real framework used is lozstrap which is a lightweight (read 'half-arsed') framework that I created – and hilariously titled – as I've done wireframes on various projects.</p>
		<p>All of the wireframes are built against this (particularly <em>library.less</em> and the JS files), so you'll want to add this (it's in the next-ten-web-3/responsive folder) as a framework in Codekit. In due course this will be replaced by a GuardianStrap (with a better name).</p>

		<h3>loznotes</h3>
		<p>The newest of the newer wireframes have annotations on them. This is using the egocentrically titled loznotes, which you can find on <a href="http://github.com/papalozarou/loznotes">github</a>.</p>

		<h3>fontawesome</h3>
		<p>And it really is. It provides generic icons to insert into projects, and it's usage is documented on the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome site</a>.</p>
 
		<h2>How it works (/is supposed to work) in practice</h2>
		<p>The basic principle is that there are .kit, .less and .js files for each wireframe.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Within the .kit file, variables will be defined and includes will be referenced.</li>
			<li>Within the .less file, variables will be defined and at least one file will be imported: 'library.less'.</li>
			<li>Within the .js files, there are sometimes other lozstrap framework files imported, for example lozstrap.show-hide.js.</li>			
		</ul>
		<p>Codekit allows you to view any file and it's dependancies in the 'files' tab of the application. Just click on a file and the imported or included files will appear in the right hand pane.</p>
		<p>The .kit includes fall into three types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Template level modules – there are only two of these that matter, '_template-header-v2.kit' and '_template-footer-v2.kit'. The header file contains the <code>&lt;doctype&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag information, including references to CSS files. The footer has references to any page specific js files. Both have references to variables, for use in file names and page titles, that the including page will supply.</li>
			<li>Page level modules – there are only three of these, '_page-footer.kit', '_page-sharing-tools.kit' and '_page-tools.kit'.</li>
			<li>Genre/type specific – includes that are related to a page genre or type, i.e. articles or sports stats pages.</li>			
		</ul>
		<p>LESS files are slightly more complicated, but they fall into two types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A base file – this can be an overarching base file, such as 'base.less' which defines styles that are used across the entire project, or page type/module specific, like 'base-article.less' or 'base-comments.less'.</li>
			<li>A page specific file – these are files that are used specifically for one page, such as 'article-live-blog-v2.less'.</li>		
		</ul>
		<p>The jQuery/JS files follow the same pattern as the LESS files, with base files and page specific files. In most instances, although a page specific file is referenced, the base file is usually the only one that exists.</p>

		<h2>File system</h2>
		<p>Firstly, an apology.</p>
		<p>The method of building files – and to an extent the file system – changed during this project, so there are a lot of files hanging around in next-gen-web-3/responsive that are legacy and which adds to the complexity of understanding how I've been working. There are (thankfully) a few basic principles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A folder is created in the document root for every page type, i.e. 'articles', 'live-blogs', 'sports-statistics', etc. Within that is a 'kit' folder.</li>
			<li>A folder is created, where necessary, for each page type within /ajax and /inc.</li>
			<li>For any given page type, the only folders you will work in are always the '/ajax', '/inc', 'kit', '/less' and '/script'.</li>
			<li>File names generally follow the format of [base-][page type][-subtype][-version number].[filetype], e.g. 'navigation-uk-politics.kit', 'article-live-blog-v2.less' or 'base-navigation.less'.</li>
			<li>To distinguish between .kit files that are pages and .kit files that are fragments we use an underscore. This has the added benefit of Codekit knowing that files that start with an underscore are for including only.</li>
			<li>The general rule of thumb is that the higher the version number at the end of the file (e.g. '_v4'), the more likely that is to be the latest.</li>
			<li>It's an easy trap to fall into, but don't open the generated .html files and edit those instead of the .kit files.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The folder structure is as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>ajax</strong> – contains any content that is pulled in via a 'load more' button</li>
			<ul>
			   <li>article</li>
			   <li>comments</li>
			   <li>live-blog</li>
			   <li>sport-statistcs</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>article</strong> – article page wireframes</li>
			<ul>
				<li>kit</strong> – kit files for the above</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>css</strong> – contains the files that are generated from the LESS files. You do to need to work in this folder</li>
			<li><strong>fnt</strong> – all fonts the project uses, including the font awesome icon font</li>
			<li><strong>img</strong> – all project images, from placeholders for images, head shots, and videos to next/previous arrows</li>
			<li><strong>inc</strong> – includes used within the project</li>
			<ul>
				<li>adverts</li>
				<li>article</li>
				<li>comments</li>
				<li>live-blog</li>
				<li>most-read</li>
				<li>navigation</li>
				<li>page</li>
				<li>sport-statistic</li>
				<li>template</li>			
			</ul>
			<li><em>index.html</em> – the homepage for the wireframes, generated from index.kit in /kit.</li>
			<li><strong>js</strong> – contains the files that are compiled and minified by Codekit. You do not need to work in this folder</li>
			<li><strong>kit</strong> – the 'index.kit' file for the whole project</li>
			<li><strong>less</strong> – all LESS files. These files compile to the /css folder</li>
			<li><em>LozStrap.zip</em> – lozstrap framework files for building against. Place this somewhere else on your HDD and add it to Codekit as a framework</li>
			<li><strong>live-blog</strong> – live blog page wireframes</li>
			<ul>
				<li>kit – kit files for the above</li>			
			</ul>
			<li><strong>navigation</strong> – UK and US navigation</li>
			<ul>
				<li>inc – this folder is redundant as all includes have been copied to /inc/navigation</li>
				<li>kit – kit files for the UK and US navigation</li>		
			</ul>
			<li><strong>oppm</strong> – one page per match wireframes</li>
			<ul>
				<li>kit – kit files for the above</li>			
			</ul>
			<li><em>robots.txt</em> – this is a file to stop search engines crawling the files contained here</li>
			<li><strong>scripts</strong> – jQuery files used by the project. These files compile to the /js folder</li>
			<li><strong>sports-statistcs</strong> – all sport statistic wireframes</li>
			<ul>
				<li>kit</strong> - kit files for the above</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>tags-etc</strong> – abandoned folder. This bit of work became the fronts track, which Karima is working on</li>
