				<p>Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the national intelligence committee, has ordered the NSA to review how it limits the exposure of Americans to government surveillance. But she made clear her disapproval of Snowden. "What he did was an act of treason," she said.</p>
				<p>Officials in European capitals demanded immediate answers from their US counterparts and denounced the practice of secretly gathering digital information on Europeans as unacceptable, illegal and a serious violation of basic rights. The NSA, meanwhile, asked the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation and said that it was assessing the damage caused by the disclosures.</p>
				<p>Daniel Ellsberg, the former military analyst who revealed secrets of the Vietnam war through the Pentagon Papers in 1971, described Snowden's leak as even more important and perhaps the most significant leak in American history.</p>
				<p>Snowden disclosed his identity in an explosive interview with the Guardian, published on Sunday, which revealed he was a 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA and current employee of the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. Snowden worked at the National Security Agency for the past four years as an employee of various outside contractors, including Booz Allen and Dell.</p>

						<h3><a href="#">Edward Snowden: what we know about the source behind the NSA files</a></h3>
						<p>His parents are divorced, he donated to Ron Paul, and his girlfriend has recently been contacted by NSA investigators</p>
					</article>
				</aside>
				<p>In his interview, Snowden revealed himself as the source for a series of articles in the Guardian last week, which included disclosures of a wide-ranging secret court order that demanded Verizon pass to the NSA the details of phone calls related to millions of customers, and a huge NSA intelligence system called Prism, which collects data on intelligence targets from the systems of some of the biggest tech companies.</p>
				<p>Snowden said he had become disillusioned with the overarching nature of government surveillance in the US. "The government has granted itself power it is not entitled to. There is no public oversight. The result is people like myself have the latitude to go further than they are allowed to," he said.</p>
				<p>"My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them."</p>

				<p>As media interest intensified on Monday, Snowden checked out of the Hong Kong hotel where he had been staying, and moved to an undisclosed location.</p>
				<p>Reacting to Snowden's revelations, Paul Ryan, the former Republican vice-presidential nominee, raised questions about whether privacy was being unduly threatened. "I'm sure somebody can come up with a great computer program that says: 'We can do X, Y, and Z,' but that doesn't mean that it's right," he told a radio station in Wisconsin. "I want to learn a lot more about it on behalf of the people I represent," he added.</p>
				<p>Pressure was growing on the White House to explain whether there was effective congressional oversight of the programmes revealed by Snowden. The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said in an NBC interview that he had responded in the "least untruthful manner" possible when he denied in congressional hearings last year that the NSA collected data on millions of Americans.</p>
				<p>Clapper also confirmed that Feinstein had asked for a review to "refine these NSA processes and limit the exposure to Americans' private communications" and report back "in about a month".</p>
				<p>In Europe, the German chancellor Angela Merkel indicated she would press Obama on the revelations at a Berlin summit next week, while deputy European Commission chief Viviane Reding said she would press US officials in Dublin on Friday, adding that "a clear legal framework for the protection of personal data is not a luxury or constraint but a fundamental right".</p>

				<p>Peter Schaar, Germany's federal data protection commissioner told the Guardian that it was unacceptable that US authorities have access to the data of European citizens "and the level of protection is lower than what is guaranteed for US citizens." His Italian counterpart, Antonello Soro, said that the data dragnet "would not be legal in Italy" and would be "contrary to the principles of our legislation and would represent a very serious violation".</p>
				<p>In London, the British foreign secretary William Hague was forced to defend the UK's use of intelligence gathered by the US. In the House of Commons, Hague told MPs that British laws did not allow for "indiscriminate trawling" for information. "There is no danger of a deep state out of control in some way," he said.</p>
				<p>But Hague was reluctant to go into detail on how Britain handled information offered by US intelligence agencies, as opposed to information requested, or whether it was subject to the same ministerial oversight, including warrants.</p>

	<p>Ed Miliband has argued that his commitment to control social security spending with a three-year independently monitored cap would not mean abandoning Labour's values on welfare.</p>
	<p>In a speech in Newham on Thursday, billed as a reframing of the welfare debate and an attempt to unify the country after Tory attempts to divide people over the issue, Miliband said: "Controlling social security spending and putting decent values at the heart of the system are not conflicting priorities. It is only by reforming social security with the right values that we'll be able to control costs.</p>
	<div id="more-politics-primary-related" class="show-hide-container" role="presentation">
		<p>"And the system does need reform. If we are going to turn our economy round, protect our NHS and build a stronger country, we will have to be laser focused on how we spend every single pound. Social security spending, vital as it is, cannot be exempt from that discipline," he said.</p>
		<p>He insisted his reforms were not a political game, but a real attempt to restore the dignity of work.</p>

	<p>George Osborne has accused Labour of hypocrisy over tax avoidance. Commenting on the revelation that a Labour donor gave a donation to the party in the form of shares to minimise his tax liability, Osborne said:</p>

		<p>"I think Ed Miliband is practising the complete opposite of what he preaches. He's gone around recently lecturing people about paying their taxes, now it emerges that his own office is advising Labour donors on how to avoid taxes. The truth is that if people don't pay their taxes, then it is difficult to fund our NHS and our schools and I think what he is doing is completely wrong."</p>
		<p>The Lib Dems have described Ed Miliband's welfare speech as "empty". "There was nothing in this speech to demonstrate Labour have a plan on the economy," said Stephen Williams, a Lib Dem MP. "Empty speeches dressed up as economic plans will not convince the British people to trust Labour again."</p>
		<p>Jeremy Hunt has said that a totally different approach to patient safety must be taken in the NHS in the light of the death in hospital of a 100-year-old great-grandmother from dehydration.</p>

	<p>The taxi driver knows exactly where to go, even though Ann Widdecombe lives 10 miles from Newton Abbot, the nearest railway station, at the top of a hill on the edge of Dartmoor. They ferry her back and forth a lot, and like her. "No airs and graces," they say. "Very down to earth." When I arrive, a few minutes late, having accepted the taxi driver's suggestion that we take the scenic route, she is waiting outside her large, functional house, which she has called Widdecombe's Rest. She walks a little creakily, and I wonder how she copes living in such a spot. Her hair is grey and windswept. The blond phase and the Strictly Come Dancing curls have gone. Truly, no airs and graces.</p>

		<p>She bought the house in 2008 and spent three years renovating it, so it was ready to move into when she retired as an MP in 2010 at the age of 62. She has had a large pond built at the front and a swimming pool installed at the back, more for her great-nephews' benefit than her own. "I used the Strictly money to pay for it," she says. The large, newly built conservatory is very Homes &amp; Gardens, but the furniture in the sitting room looks like it has followed her round every house she has ever owned. The ancient coffee table is so heavy we can hardly move it. On the top sit two DVDs – Dr Finlay's Casebook and The Virgin Queen, a 1955 film starring Bette Davis as Elizabeth I. I suspect 1920s Scotland and late 16th-century England might both appeal more to her than 21st-century Britain.</p>
		<p>Widdecombe's autobiography, Strictly Ann, is published this week, an account of her combative life in politics and curious afterlife in showbiz, hosting Have I Got News for You, acting as quizmaster on a short-lived Sky programme called Cleverdicks, twice starring with Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood in panto, even appearing on stage at the Royal Opera House playing the Duchesse de Krakentorp in Donizetti's La Fille du Régiment, to the horror of opera purists. The book is breezily written, as befits the author of four novels, and characteristically honest, though the halfhearted attacks on excessive bureaucracy and national fecklessness are rather wearing, as if her editor is constantly reminding her to conform to strident, rightwing type.</p>
		<p>I had been hoping she would be bossy with me, too, perhaps berating me for my lateness, since it's always easier to print the legend. But I'm disappointed. She makes me a cup of tea and promises me some homemade Victoria sponge later – made not by her but by a neighbour who acts as a part-time housekeeper. Her love of animals, especially cats (her website lists every cat she has ever owned), and vigorous opposition to foxhunting belie her tough-as-nails image, and the Victoria sponge may be the icing on the revisionist cake.</p>

		<p>Clegg said he had decided to block the plans by the Conservative children's minister, Liz Truss, because an extensive consultation had shown that her two key aims would fail. Relaxing child-to-staff ratios would not necessarily drive down the costs of childcare – and might even increase them – and would not necessarily improve standards, he said.</p>
		<p>In a sign of how coalition policymaking has descended into hand-to-hand combat between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, Downing Street appeared to be caught off guard by the Clegg announcement.</p>
		<p>A No 10 source said the government's planned childcare policy had not yet been agreed and would be announced shortly. "It is a bit premature to brief before the final package has been agreed," one senior Tory source said of the Clegg move. "It is not really the way to behave."</p>

	<p>Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has sought to defuse the row over the crisis in A&amp;E by announcing a fundamental review of emergency care, conceding that "we have failed to give the public confidence that there's anything between GP surgeries and A&amp;E".</p>

		<p>The review, which will result in action by next April, will focus on "vulnerable older people", who Hunt said were the heaviest users of the NHS. In an attempt to broaden discussion about the system's failings Hunt, speaking without notes at the annual NHS Confederation conference for health service managers, said A&amp;E was a "barometer" of the NHS and admitted: "When things go wrong [it] tends to show up there."</p>
		<p>Earlier this week the King's Fund warned that waiting times for A&amp;E patients had hit a nine-year high and the number of people waiting more than four hours to see a doctor had almost doubled since last year.</p>
		<p>Hunt said the review, to be led by NHS England's medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, would tie together the vexed issues of whether there should be closures of accident and emergency units across the country; how to get elderly patients out into the community to free up hospital beds; and how the GP contract could be altered to get family doctors to become accountable for the care of vulnerable older people outside A&amp;E.</p>

		<p>Julia Gillard rounded on the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, for standing behind the LNP’s candidate for Fisher. She also implicated Abbott in a “pattern of behaviour” culminating in the LNP choosing to display a “grossly offensive and sexist menu” at a fundraiser for Brough in Brisbane in late March.</p>
		<p>“Mr Brough should be disendorsed, that’s what should happen here,” Gillard told reporters in Perth on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
		<p>“Let’s go through the pattern of behaviour. Mr Abbott personally has gone and stood next to signs that described me in a sexist way. We’ve had the Young Liberals hosting a function where jokes were cracked about the death of my father. And now, we have Mr Brough and Mr Hockey at a function with this grossly sexist and offensive menu on display,” she said.</p>

	<p>Britain's workers have suffered more financial pain since 2008 than in any five-year period of the modern age, according to research by a leading tax thinktank that shows employees have sacrificed pay to keep their jobs.</p>

		<p>Describing this downturn as the longest and deepest slump in a century, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says workers have suffered unprecedented pay cuts of 6% in real terms over the last five years.</p>
		<p>Historically, real wages rise by about 2% a year. This suggests that people are more than 15% worse off than they would have been if the pre-crisis wage trends had continued.</p>
		<p>Analysing downturns going back to the great depression, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: "This time really does seem to be different … it has been deeper and longer than those of the 1990s, the 1980s and even the 1930s. It has seen household incomes and spending drop more and stay lower longer."</p>

	<p>A schoolgirl has told a court how she ran away to France with her married maths teacher after their sexual relationship was discovered, dumping her schoolbag and uniform in a bin in Paris as the pair tried to avoid attention.</p>

		<p>The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, first met Jeremy Forrest when she was 13 and he took her maths class at Bishop Bell school, in Eastbourne, East Sussex.</p>
		<p>She described how a normal pupil-teacher relationship, in which she called him "sir" and he disciplined her for wearing nail varnish or non-regulation school uniform, altered as she confided personal problems to him, and they began exchanging flirtatious Twitter and text messages. Shortly after her 15th birthday the pair started having sex, Lewes crown court heard.</p>
		<p>When police alerted by rumours at the school seized the girl's mobile phone – which was found to hold photographs sent by the 30-year-old teacher, including one showing him with his hands down his boxer shorts – the pair realised they were about to be discovered. The court was told the pair fled for France the day after she was questioned by police in the presence of a child protection officer.</p>

	<p>Greek state TV and radio were gradually pulled off the air late on Tuesday, hours after the government said it would temporarily close all state-run broadcasts and lay off about 2,500 workers as part of a cost-cutting drive demanded by the bailed-out country's international creditors.</p>
	<div id="more-guardian-quinary-related" class="show-hide-container" role="presentation">
		<p>TV and radio stations of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation, or ERT, were pulled off the air in several parts of the country from about 11pm (9pm BST), about an hour before the government said all signals would go dead, although satellite broadcasts continued.</p>
		<p>The conservative-led government said ERT would reopen "as soon as possible" with a new, smaller workforce. It wasn't immediately clear how long that would take, and whether all stations would reopen.</p>
		<p>"Congratulations to the Greek government," newscaster Antonis Alafogiorgos said toward the end of ERT's main TV live broadcast. "This is a blow to democracy."</p>
